### What is this?

Icecold is a tool designed to generate wordlists based on websites, it does this by scraping words and combining and modifying them into forms that are commonly used as passwords.

This is a very CTF-esque tool, as a common CTF category is creating passwords based off a specific theme or topic. It still has applications in real world password recovery, it could have been used that time you found a Raspberry Pi in your closet and you were _pretty sure_ the password was Love Live themed.
